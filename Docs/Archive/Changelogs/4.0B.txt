Beta 4.0:
* NOTE! I accidentally deleted the changelog from before the version number changed, so things like holographic avatars, although implemented, aren't logged. [Entered by Cray West]
* Added a sound for taking holo pics with Lore computers. [Entered by Cray West]
* Added a WakeOnRed (conf wake) mode, which will disable mute and gagging when red alert is initiated. [Entered by Cray West]
* Hopefully fixed blades now. [Entered by Cray West]
* Updated the version number, to further preven the horrible load error on some pesky systems! (Thanks Nyla for the loan of the Jaws tandom session, and I hope Ehmjay can forgive us some day!). [Entered by Cray West]
* Added a SetPerms.bat file to the main Miriani directory, which can be used to fix permissions. [Entered by Cray West]
* Rewritten the Readme to make it more up-to-date [Entered by Cray West]
* Removed some more illegal aliases I missed last time. Sorry bn, br, and c users! [Entered by Cray West]
* Fixed the dir command, to not crash message boards and other menu structures when outside a ship. [Entered by Cray West]
* Added an array to contain planet classifications, so each class can have a different sound. [Entered by Cray West]
* Made port redirection work properly. [Entered by Cray West]
* Updated wavewarp sounds to bring the ending sequence in line with the other drives. [Entered by Cray West]
* Added an option to show the number of exits in a room when pressing alt space. [Entered by Cray West]
* Removed LFollow to save space as no one's using it and it's probably full of bugs anyways. [Entered by Cray West]
* Replaced the slightly disused realism mode, and replaced it with another option in conf ship, which uses recorded speech to speak certain computer messages like the autopilot enable / disable notifications. [Entered by Cray West]
* Tightened up the ship's computer code, to make it more streamlined, and to save up on trigger space. [Entered by Cray West]
* Removed a load of redundant triggers, to avoid the fast approaching Vipmud trigger limit. [Entered by Cray West]
* A whole load of asteroid mining fixes, new sounds, etc. [Entered by Cray West]
* Added a new mode which gags discovered minerals on asteroids (type surveying to check it out). [Entered by Cray West]
* Formatted asteroids a bit better, so you can navigate round them quicker. [Entered by Cray West]
* Fixed droid remotes to not mess up when you see camera output through them... Confusing, huh? [Entered by Cray West]
* Added a trigger to catch the messages from external PA systems while outside. [Entered by Cray West]
* Added highguard ships to be handled by scan filters. [Entered by Cray West]
* Added an exppipe for coordinates already being locked. [Entered by Cray West]
* Make ships locking and unlocking show on the exteria cameras. [Entered by Cray West]

* Made it possible to set both the org name and the name of the courier company by using the score command. [Entered by Cray West]
* Added a gag option to confmanager, which can be accessed through either conf gag, or control f12, or with the gageverything command. This option gags all mud output, without the stupid annoying message that Vipmud uses, which kind of screws up the point of gagging in the first place... [Entered by Cray West]
* Added extra sounds for Stun batons [Entered by Cray West]
