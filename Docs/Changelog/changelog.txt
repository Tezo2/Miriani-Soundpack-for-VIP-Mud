Version 5.8.57, released 2017-10-02:
* For 2.0: Fixed display sound not playing when checking weapons from an engineering room. Thanks Anny Rain for reporting.

Version 5.8.56, released 2017-10-02:
* For 2.0: Fixed a bug in SCGC that caused a recursive loop error. Thanks to Josh Westen for reporting this.

Version 5.8.55, released 2017-10-02:
* For 2.0: Moved CGC and related code to a CGC extra. You can toggle it with conf x cgc.

Version 5.8.54, released 2017-10-02:
* For 2.0: conf gen 3 now has support for room-o 22. Or in less cryptic words, room title formatting is now capable of indicating if a room is outdoors.

Version 5.8.53, released 2017-10-02:
* For 2.0: Receiving contributions should no longer trigger the credit reward sound if it's less than a second since you earned credits for completing a mission.

Version 5.8.52, released 2017-09-30:
* For 2.0: Fixed the computer announcement sound so that it plays the right sound when the announcement is piped from the control room.

Version 5.8.51, released 2017-09-28:
* For 2.0: Maybe I fixed issues with dig sites producing lots and lots of errors.

Version 5.8.50, released 2017-09-27:
* For 2.0: Removed the option to block history buffers.

Version 5.8.49, released 2017-09-27:
* For 2.0: Made the routine for calculating relative numeric directions more efficient. Maybe the performance improvement will be slightly noticeable when using sms and other commands that rely on this routine. Who knows.
* For 2.0: Triggers pertaining to atmo, ACV, and archaeology will be loaded when needed, rather than when the soundpack starts. This means the soundpack might load a little faster when you connect to Miriani.

Version 5.8.48, released 2017-09-26:
* For 2.0: Added sounds for exiting simulators in general, and for entering starship simulators in particular.

Version 5.8.47, released 2017-09-24:
* For 2.0: Added new sounds for comm services, asteroid notification, and star notification. These new sounds will only play if you have Miriani Soundpack Sounds version 3 or higher. Thanks to Jessie Vargus for providing these new sounds.

Version 5.8.46, released 2017-09-24:
* For 2.0: Credit reward sounds will be played only one time per second, effectively preventing a halestorm of credit sounds upon completing missions etc.

Version 5.8.45, released 2017-09-24:
* For 2.0: A few small performance improvements. It's getting increasingly more tricky to squeeze more performance out of the soundpack, but every fraction of a boost helps.

Version 5.8.44, released 2017-09-24:
* For 2.0: Fixed footstep sounds being triggered by lifts moving up and down. Thanks to Josh Westen for reporting this.

Version 5.8.43, released 2017-09-24:
* For 2.0: Added an ExpPipe for the output of the ABOUT command.
* For 2.0: Fixed an error when changing the alert status to green. Thanks Anny Rain for letting me know about this error.

Version 5.8.42, released 2017-09-23:
* For 2.0: More performance improvements.

Version 5.8.41, released 2017-09-23:
* For 2.0: Made it possible to turn room sounds partially on. This means the soundpack will skip the step of iterating through wildcards to find the correct room sound, which might boost performance when walking or looking in the room.

Version 5.8.40, released 2017-09-23:
* For 2.0: Ported some legacy 1.1 code to 2.0, for better performance.

Version 5.8.39, released 2017-09-23:
* For 2.0: Fixed several issues with scanning. Station format string works again, and several scan titles are now being properly gagged.

Version 5.8.38, released 2017-09-22:
* Fixed unload gun sound not working. Thanks again Anny for reporting.

Version 5.8.37, released 2017-09-22:
* For 2.0: Fixed certain notification sounds not playing. Thanks Anny Rain for reporting this.

Version 5.8.36, released 2017-09-22:
* For 2.0: Removed some superfluous Lore computer output for experience level 3.

Version 5.8.35, released 2017-09-22:
* For 2.0: Fixed weird output of hit and partial hit messages.

Version 5.8.34, released 2017-09-22:
* For 2.0: Fixed issues with computer messages.

Version 5.8.33, released 2017-09-19:
* For 2.0: Fixed bugs with starship computer messages.

Version 5.8.32, released 2017-09-19:
* For 2.0: Fixed a bug with the output of the move command for starships.

Version 5.8.31, released 2017-09-19:
* For 2.0: Performance improvements.

Version 5.8.30, released 2017-09-19:
* For 2.0: Improved performance for ExpPipe, and maybe I fixed some other bugs as well.

Version 5.8.29, released 2017-09-17:
* For 2.0: You can now look at Anny Rain without triggering the clip thing to belt sound.

Version 5.8.28, released 2017-09-17:
* Added a sound for the yodel social.

Version 5.8.27, released 2017-09-17:
* For 2.0: Fixed a bug that caused the soundpack to strip away a little too much of sitting messages under certain conditions.

Version 5.8.26, released 2017-09-16:
* For 2.0: Fixed issues with scanning filters. Newbie ships and discernable crafts on planets should now be recognized.

Version 5.8.25, released 2017-09-14:
* For 2.0: Removed the Books extra because it was super old, and it's almost three years since Miriani made it possible to turn a book to next or previous page anyway.

Version 5.8.24, released 2017-09-14:
* For 2.0: More performance improvements for the soundpack.

Version 5.8.23, released 2017-09-14:
* For 2.0: Moved code for Laser Tag into an extra. It's enabled by default, but you can disable it for a little better performance.
* For 2.0: Added another performance booster for the soundpack.

Version 5.8.22, released 2017-09-13:
* For 2.0: Possibly made whoc a little more reliable.

Version 5.8.21, released 2017-09-13:
* For 2.0: Integrated most of the extras pertaining to archaeology into the main soundpack code, and greatly improved things in the process. For those of you who were used to the ArchaeologyHelper extra, there's now a new option in conf gadgets which toggles that functionality. And archaeology should now work without throwing errors in 3D aquatic environments. I hope these new changes are not too buggy.

Version 5.8.20, released 2017-09-12:
* For 2.0: Fixed a bug in scanning that made it count the word Underfilled as one occupant.

Version 5.8.19, released 2017-09-12:
* For 2.0: Fixed a bug that caused conf to fail if you tried to access an option directly from a menu that was not in the main menu. For instance when typing conf sc 3.

Version 5.8.18, released 2017-09-11:
* For 2.0: Fixed Integrity not being filtered by the scan filters.

Version 5.8.17, released 2017-09-10:
* For 2.0: Fixed a bug with conf gadget 7. Sometimes it would say weird things like, sector 30 Asteroid mining Outpost to sector 30 flight control, bla bla bla. But fear not, the fix is here!

Version 5.8.16, released 2017-09-10:
* For 2.0: Merged conf lore, conf message boards, and conf point units into conf gadgets. Also added a new option in conf gadgets for showing sector names as numbers in FC messages.

Version 5.8.15, released 2017-09-09:
* For 2.0: Fixed SM Filters. Apparently I broke it earlier this week. Sorry about that.

Version 5.8.14, released 2017-09-08:
* For 2.0: More performance improvements.
* For 2.0: Fixed a bug that caused critical component sound to be played sometimes when checking the charge readout. Also changed it so it only plays critical component sounds if the component is between 80 and 99 percent damaged.

Version 5.8.13, released 2017-09-07:
* For 2.0: Packed four triggers into one. Every fraction of performance improvement helps.

Version 5.8.12, released 2017-09-07:
* For 2.0: Several bug fixes and more performance improvements. Also changed the default format string for message board headers. You'll have to manually set it to the new default value in conf mess if you want to use it. And the soundpack should now play a sound if a component is at 80 percent damage or higher when checking damage.
* For 2.0: Fixed prompt sound playing twice for lift menus.

Version 5.8.11, released 2017-09-04:
* For 2.0: Fixed the scanning framework not picking up combat drones in simulators if the drones were member of the Alliance of Mindless Simulator Drones. Also added type information when scanning praelor ships, which has not been tested but should hopefully work.

Version 5.8.10, released 2017-09-03:
* For 2.0: Fixed a bug in the footsteps framework that slowed down the ping and the lag commands by like 10 or more milliseconds.

Version 5.8.9, released 2017-09-01:
* For 2.0: Changed the default scan format strings for stars and debris.

Version 5.8.8, released 2017-09-01:
* For 2.0: Made the scan output of debris a little better if you're using scan filters (conf scan 1) and don't have the debris scanner upgrade installed.

Version 5.8.7, released 2017-09-01:
* For 2.0: Rewrote the scanning framework. This means your old scan format string no longer exists. Instead, there are now format strings for most of the different types of objects you can scan. The default format strings will probably suffice for most people though. It's all in conf sc. Just remember that the scan filters must be enabled for these to have any effect (conf sc 1). There are also two new speech interrupts for the new scanning framework. You'll find them in conf speech. And finally, I removed the Scanning Enhancement extra because it was utterly useless.

Version 5.8.6, released 2017-08-30:
* For 2.0: Removed the conf gen option for displaying statistics when disconnecting, since all that stuff is now gone anyway.

Version 5.8.5, released 2017-08-30:
* For 2.0: Removed some code for debugging that caused it to say stopping speech every time you walked into a room.

Version 5.8.4, released 2017-08-30:
* For 2.0: Fixed several things related to connecting and room sounds and... well, lots of things. Also removed the soundpack statistics thing since it was just hogging resources for no useful reason. And added a little counter for conf x that indicates how many extras are currently enabled. Woop woop!

Version 5.8.3, released 2017-08-30:
* Fixed an issue that prevented the soundpack from being loaded when connecting to Miriani.

Version 5.8.2, released 2017-08-30:
* For 2.0: I think I fixed cases where the clip things to belt sounds were not working. Thanks Michael Calaway for reporting about this!

Version 5.8.1, released 2017-08-29:
* For 2.0: Fixed a few bugs in the Shenanigans extra.

Version 5.8.0, released 2017-08-29:
* For 2.0: Removed seemingly superfluous triggers for spacesuit bags. Thanks to Ryan Salvatore for the spacesuit stripping show that revealed all the details I needed to know.
* For 2.0: conf x is now an alias for conf extras. So yes, you can type e.g. conf x can to toggle the cannons extra.
* For 2.0: Moved the triggers for fishing to a new Fishing extra. Conf extra fishing to toggle it, or just conf x fish for short.
* For 2.0: Moved more than 100 triggers into the extras framework. The new extras are Games, Socials, and Shenanigans, and you can toggle them in conf extras. These new extras are disabled by default, so if you're missing the sounds of your favorite popcorn maker, swimming sounds, or other RP sounds, then try turning on conf x social and it should work for you again. conf x games is what you need if you want sounds for games such as air hockey, skeeball, etc.
* For 2.0: Added an option in conf sounds that lets you toggle the spam spam spam sound.
* For 2.0: Fixed the belt sounds so that you hear them when other people clip and unclip things to their belts, not just when you do it.
* For 2.0: Removed the option for gagging load messages for extras, since they now won't show under normal circumstances anyway.
* For 2.0: Made conf x babies, conf x socials, and conf x games enabled by default.
* For 2.0: Fixed knock sounds so they work when other people knock on starships and you're standing on the landing pad with them.

Version 5.7.36, released 2017-08-28:
* For 2.0: Moved 36 triggers related to baby sounds into a Babies extra. This means you need to enable baby sounds in conf extras if you still want that.

Version 5.7.35, released 2017-08-28:
* For 2.0: Removed a buggy workaround for the info command that was necessary to keep the output in order while the YouActionsW crap was around. Since that horribleness has been removed, the workaround can go too.

Version 5.7.34, released 2017-08-28:
* For 2.0: Transformed the data in YouActionsW.set into regular triggers. It may reduce performance, but it fixes lots of horrible and inexplicable bugs, such as the order of lines of incoming text being shuffled sometimes. I'll try to come up with another plan of improving performance again later.

Version 5.7.33, released 2017-08-28:
* For 2.0: Fixed a bug in the communication framework that basically made it ignore messages occasionally.

Version 5.7.32, released 2017-08-27:
* For 2.0: Fixed errors in the new footsteps framework caused by a race condition.

Version 5.7.31, released 2017-08-27:
* For 2.0: Rewrote the footsteps framework. The biggest change for now is that it supports mountable things, but the sound engine is also ready for cool things such as panning of footstep sounds based on direction, different sounds for different walk styles, etc. I may or may not implement those things at some point.

Version 5.7.30, released 2017-08-26:
* For 2.0: Fixed a few small bugs in the SM filters.
* For 2.0: Fixed a few bugs with the course command and the focus command. Also removed several superfluous triggers to improve performance.
* For 2.0: Added the Nothing to Scan sound for the focus command when there are no ships in the sector.

Version 5.7.29, released 2017-08-22:
* For 2.0: CHI HOST will no longer touch the communication framework inappropriately.

Version 5.7.28, released 2017-08-22:
* For 2.0: Removed the setup command, plus two triggers that were associated with it. I might create a soundpack extra that sets up Miriani to work better with the soundpack at some point in the future.

Version 5.7.27, released 2017-08-20:
* For 2.0: Added default value and current value to the option value prompts in the conf manager.

Version 5.7.26, released 2017-08-20:
* For 2.0: Brought back the message board options to the conf manager. Also refreshed the message board code so that it now supports voting.

Version 5.7.25, released 2017-08-20:
* For 2.0: Merged the roomsounds command into conf rooms. Previously the conf roomsounds menu was hidden behind the roomsounds command, which meant room sound volume offset was kind of hidden as well. Cheers Ryan Salvatore for pointing this out.

Version 5.7.24, released 2017-08-20:
* For 2.0: Not sure what I was smoking when naming the alias for toggling the Do Not Disturb mode, but it has now been renamed to dnd.

Version 5.7.23, released 2017-08-20:
* For 2.0: Added the dnt command (Do Not Disturb). You can use it as a toggle, or you can type dnt on or dnt off to turn it on or off explicitly. It is equivalent of setting both mastermute on/off and speech on/off.
* For 2.0: The wake on red alert option that used to be in conf gag has now been moved to conf gen. It now also applies to the dnt command, and if enabled, it will disable the Do Not Disturb mode whenever the starship is set to red, blue, purple, or orange alert. And lastly, conf wake is a shortcut for this option.

Version 5.7.22, released 2017-08-20:
* For 2.0: More conf alias improvements. Now it will accept commands like conf atsm, conf vd, conf rooms, conf save, conf load, etc. Conf load and conf save even accept numeric arguments that indicate which backup file to use. For instance, conf save 1 will save the current configuration to the first backup file. Another example is conf load default, which will load default settings.
* For 2.0: Based on the configuration that is being loaded, conf load will now enable/disable extras, keystrokes, room sounds, and SP Keep-Alive routines. Let me know if you find other things that aren't properly enabled or disabled when you use conf load to switch between configuration files.

Version 5.7.21, released 2017-08-20:
* For 2.0: Improved aliases in the new conf manager.
* For 2.0: Fixed the bug with ConfLoad default. This also means that the load default configuration option in conf conf has been fixed.
* For 1.1: Addressed an issue that caused an error whenever you hauled an asteroid to a station. Thanks to Calyssa Calaway for reporting this! And thanks Kendall Gideon for fixing it!

Version 5.7.20, released 2017-08-19:
* Added a sound for soundpack update notifications.

Version 5.7.19, released 2017-08-19:
* For 2.0: Fixed a little bug I inadvertently created in the last version that caused the soundpack to complain about incorrect syntax for the speech command. Whoops.

Version 5.7.18, released 2017-08-19:
* The soundpack will now produce a notification for you when loading the soundpack if you don't have the most recent version of the sounds folder.

Version 5.7.17, released 2017-08-19:
* Added sounds version to spinfo. At the time of this writing, the soundpack needs sounds version 2. If it doesn't say sounds version 2, then you need to download the latest sounds folder. Link can be found in Miriani by typing @soundpacks, and then choose 4.

Version 5.7.16, released 2017-08-17:
* For 2.0: Rewrote the contribs command. Contributors will now be properly sorted based on the amount they've contributed.
* Fixed multi line prompts not being picked up by the soundpack.

Version 5.7.15, released 2017-08-15:
* For 2.0: Fixed conf ship 18. It just wouldn't let you change that option. Thanks to Derrick Blade for letting me know about this bug.

Version 5.7.14, released 2017-08-15:
* For 2.0: You can now make backups of your configuration file. Check out conf conf, and hopefully it'll be self explanatory from there.

Version 5.7.13, released 2017-08-15:
* For 2.0: Removed the Conf Manager Object index number, since the new conf manager is now resilient enough to live without it.

Version 5.7.12, released 2017-08-15:
* Fixed errors playing certain sound files in aquatic salvaging. Thanks Chailyn and Kylar for reporting this!

Version 5.7.11, released 2017-08-15:
* For 2.0: Made the soundpack more resilient when dealing with damaged configuration files.

Version 5.7.10, released 2017-08-15:
* For 2.0: Updated the camera feed framework so that it now points to the right sounds for empty guns. Thanks Derrick Blade for reporting!

Version 5.7.9, released 2017-08-15:
* For 2.0: Fixed a little bug in the new conf manager that caused menus to show up when you accessed option aliases, such as conf save, conf exp, conf mission, etc.
* For 2.0: Fixed an ancient bug that caused social toggles and also virtual display settings to get lost under certain circumstances. Now those settings should stick around more reliably than ever before!
* For 2.0: More bug fixes in the startup routine of the soundpack.

Version 5.7.8, released 2017-08-13:
* For 2.0: Made lots of improvements for the conf manager. Mostly performance improvements, but also several bug fixes and stuffs.

Version 5.7.7, released 2017-08-13:
* For 2.0: Rewrote the social toggles and implemented it into the new conf manager. It's all in conf socials. Let me know if something doesn't work as expected.

Version 5.7.6, released 2017-08-13:
* Made a few modifications to the soundpack update notifications.
* For 2.0: Improved overall performance by moving a bunch of code into a Development extra. There's no need for the soundpack to load development routines for everyone.

Version 5.7.5, released 2017-08-13:
* For 2.0: Made a little improvement to the whoc command's behavior when it runs for the first time after the soundpack has been loaded.

Version 5.7.4, released 2017-08-13:
* For 2.0: Removed the option to reload the extras in conf extras, since it would probably never be necessary for anyone to do that.

Version 5.7.3, released 2017-08-13:
* For 2.0: Fixed a small but serious bug in the conf extras menu. Cheers Josh for your rapid detection and reporting of this issue!

Version 5.7.2, released 2017-08-13:
* For 2.0: More performance improvements. Rewrote the extras framework, and it's no longer being the huge resource hog that it used to be. You might even notice a slight performance boost when you enter and exit starships because of this change. Also added the extras menu to the new conf manager.

Version 5.7.1, released 2017-08-13:
* For 2.0: More performance improvements. Removed the menus framework since it was just annoying to lots of people, and it was hogging resources even when it was not really in use. And since many menus in Miriani now accepts text input, the menus framework was kind of obsolete at any rate. And finally layed the numpad.set file to rest, since it was consuming resources without being of any use to anyone in the slightest. These changes may cause things to crash that I haven't thought of, so please let me know if you encounter bugs or unexpected oddities.

Version 5.7.0, released 2017-08-12:
* For 2.0: A shiny new conf manager has now replaced the old and slow conf manager. I know there are still a few options missing, and I'll keep working on that. But I think the most essential stuff will work nicely. This new conf manager is much much better in terms of performance as well as usability. I also redesigned the keystroke framework. It's much faster too now.
* For 2.0: Fixed a bug with the secho framework that could potentially cause captions and options to get separated if the timing of other unrelated game output was not so right.

Version 5.6.12, released 2017-08-11:
* For 2.0: The RoomSounds command uses secho now.

Version 5.6.11, released 2017-08-11:
* For 2.0: The BufferConfig command now uses secho instead of command prefix in the entry window.

Version 5.6.10, released 2017-08-11:
* For 2.0: The VD command will now utilize secho in Miriani instead of printing a command prefix to the entry window.

Version 5.6.9, released 2017-08-11:
* Fixed more incorrect sound paths for certain salvager sounds. Thanks again, Daryk.

Version 5.6.8, released 2017-08-11:
* Fixed a few incorrect paths to salvage sounds. Thanks Daryk Karlsen for reporting this.

Version 5.6.7, released 2017-08-10:
* Removed some very old and now unused code from the trigger that plays the rel drive start sound.

Version 5.6.6, released 2017-08-08:
* For 2.0: Added a new soundpack prompt framework that utilizes the new secho command in Miriani. This probably doesn't mean anything for most users, but I'm currently in the process of rewriting the conf manager, and the new conf manager will definitely make good use of this new prompt framework.
* For 2.0: Added a history buffer for private link services. The buffer is named Services. This means services like auction service and combat mission notification service won't clutter your private comm history buffer. Woop woop! We might add a new sound for services too one day, who knows.

Version 5.6.5, released 2017-08-05:
* Applied a workaround for the issue with conf vol (and other conf aliases pointing to executable conf objects). Cheers Josh for reporting.

Version 5.6.4, released 2017-08-05:
* For 2.0: Fixed bugs in the bufferconfig command.

Version 5.6.3, released 2017-08-05:
* For 2.0: Changed the virtual displays for camera feeds. Now the first one applies for internal camera feeds, like internal stun turrets and security cameras on private space stations etc. vd 2 is for external camera feeds, like droid remotes and external cameras on BC's.

Version 5.6.2, released 2017-08-05:
* Josh Westen updated Docs/Keys.txt by removing a number of keystroke definitions that no longer exist in the soundpack because of not so recent policy changes in Miriani. Plus a few other modifications to that file.
* Removed script, sounds, and themes path options from conf advanced, since the preferred method for setting these paths now is by using the linking scripts. Also removed the file extension options and the ignored script files option, because the only thing you could do with them was to crash the soundpack, so not very useful. Also added a CExt variable for those of you who might be interested. The plan at this point is to compress some (or even most) of the sounds into mp3, and only use .wav for time critical things pertaining to missions, combat, grabbing, stunning, etc.

Version 5.6.1, released 2017-08-04:
* Implemented version control for sounds, and fixed numerous bugs that I spotted along the way. What the version control for sounds means to the end user is that the soundpack will now detect if you have the required version of the sounds folder before it attempts to play a new sound, instead of crashing your soundpack because the sound file doesn't exist. You will need to get the sounds folder that was released today though for this to work properly. The sounds folder will from this day on have support for this version control feature. You can download Miriani Soundpack Sounds.zip from the link in @soundpacks. If you have access to the Miriani Soundpack Sounds in Dropbox, then all of this will go automatically so there's nothing you'll need to do.

Version 5.6.0, released 2017-08-04:
* We've been tidying the sounds folder, and as a result of that, you might need to download the latest sounds folder unless you have access to the shared Dropbox folder for the sounds. The new sounds folder will also have a version number that VIP Mud can load programmatically, which means that future releases of the soundpack won't unceremoniously crash even if you don't have the most recent sounds folder. But first, you need to download the sounds folder that was released today.
* Also added some new sounds. There's a new sound for alliance computer notifications, and that old alliance computer sound is now used to alert you of blast door intrusions. Also added a sound for cutting torches, plus a new sound that indicates no nearby debris when salvaging. There are probably other changes too, but those are the ones I recall at this time.
* For 2.0: Removed a superfluous trigger in the name of performance, and also improved the little framework that handles computer report messages.

Version 5.5.13, released 2017-08-04:
* For 2.0: Added a little message for the first time you use whoc after the soundpack has been loaded.
* Addressed an issue where the soundpack wouldn't show you the color of the Lore computer that someone was using.
* For 2.0: Fixed several issues with messages starting with The computer reports. Now experience level 3 should filter that prefix and only show the relevant message.

Version 5.5.12, released 2017-08-03:
* For 2.0: Now the whoc command says checking when it starts, because the results are a bit slower to show up with this new workaround for whoc, and it just felt good to make it say something to fill the kind of awkward silence before the results come.

Version 5.5.11, released 2017-08-03:
* Fixed a horrible bug in the whoc command. It really messed up the soundpack if everyone happened to be in comms range, or if noone were out of local space. I had to apply a crazy workaround to make sure this will work regardless of the footer of the who command, which also means I just had to remove whoc entirely from the 1.1 version since I can't do the kind of extensive testing there that would be necessary to make this work. Also, whoc now utilizes the benefits of the command echo control in 2.0, which doesn't even exist in 1.1. So yeah, if you still want to use whoc, VIP Mud 2.0 is the way to go.
* For 2.0: Addressed the issue that caused intrasector subwarp, slip, etc to mess with camera feeds.
* For 2.0: Changed the default volume offsets for virtual displays from -10 to -20. This change will only apply for new configs.

Version 5.5.10, released 2017-08-03:
* For 2.0: Sound engine improvements. Now it uses a more correct formula for all the volume offsets. This means that you might need to reconfigure some of your volume diffs if things are suddenly a little bit too quiet or a little bit too loud. Previous behavior was that a volume offset would add or subtract from master volume. New formula treats the offsets as a percentage of master volume, which definitely makes volume management easier. I also made the sound engine a tad more efficient in terms of performance, by removing some unnecessary workarounds and things.

Version 5.5.9, released 2017-08-02:
* For 2.0: Debris salvage messages now use your experience level instead of a virtual display. It'll also use a little more sound effects to indicate that things are happening.
* For 2.0: Since I freed up a slot in the list of virtual displays, I decided to move the intrasector combat messages to VD 4, and add an extra display for droid remotes. You might need to reconfigure your virtual displays now though since your configuration won't take into account the new order of virtual displays.

Version 5.5.8, released 2017-08-02:
* Fixed a bug that made it look like people were in the same room with you if they used a Lore computer and your character saw it through a camera feed.

Version 5.5.7, released 2017-08-02:
* Added a helpful hint to the message you see when toggling command echo using conf gen commandecho.

Version 5.5.6, released 2017-08-02:
* Lots of changes in the version for VIP Mud 2.0. Removed the MOTD stuff from conf since it was just reserving resources that would never ever be used. Added conf gen CommandEcho, which sets whether or not commands sent to the game will be displayed in the output window. This effectively means that this option will override whatever you define in VIP Mud's option for displaying commands in the output window. The reason for this is that the soundpack will now have the ability to selectively choose whether or not a command should be displayed in the output window, which is useful for keep alive and other things that you just don't want to see in the output window. Also, the soundpack will now set the option for opening scripts in read only mode to True, and the option for auto save script changes to false. Hopefully that will prevent people from accidentally messing up their soundpacks and then complaining about soundpack not working.

Version 5.5.5, released 2017-08-02:
* Added character encoding for the rooc command.

Version 5.5.4, released 2017-08-02:
* Whoops. Apparently I created a major bug in the comms framework with version 5.5.3. It has been fixed now, hopefully.

Version 5.5.3, released 2017-08-02:
* Lots of improvements and bug fixes for camera feeds and virtual displays (for VIP Mud 2.0). Now the volume offsets for all virtual displays should work correctly.
* The beep for being granted access to a house works again. Thanks Ryan Salvatore for reporting this!

Version 5.5.2, released 2017-08-01:
* Volume offset for Virtual Display 5 and 6 (Metafrequency messages and Communicator messages) works now! (VIP Mud 2.0 only).

Version 5.5.1, released 2017-08-01:
* Added Turkish to conf comm encoding. I hope it works for those of you who speak turkish. For both VIP Mud 1.1 and 2.0.

Version 5.5.0, released 2017-08-01:
* Improved the character encoding engine in the soundpack. Now it will decode all special characters received through comms and the say command, regardless of your encoding settings. You need to configure your language in conf comm encoding if you want to transmit special characters, though. Currently it supports French, German, and Norwegian. Be aware that only this soundpack will be able to decode these special characters, but at least you can use it when talking privately with friends who also use this soundpack. Also, this new improved character encoding engine is not backward compatible with older versions of this soundpack, but I added it for both VIP Mud 1.1 and 2.0.
* Added Spanish to the character encoding engine for both VIP Mud 1.1 and 2.0. Can be configured in conf comm encoding.

Version 5.4.28, released 2017-08-01:
* Added Control 1-0 to the BufferConfig for the sake of list completion, plus it holds some useful information.

Version 5.4.27, released 2017-08-01:
* Added filters to virtual displays (for VIP Mud 2.0 only). You can configure these in conf vd, and they are useful if you want a virtual display to gag something only if it also matches a certain pattern.
* The vd menu will now also display any active display filters.

Version 5.4.26, released 2017-08-01:
* Another improvement to the VD command. Now if you type vd and a number, it will toggle that virtual display without opening up the entire menu. If you just type vd without any arguments however, it will present the menu and let you interact with it just like conf. Also made it so that it will save the settings if you choose 0 from the VD menu.

Version 5.4.25, released 2017-07-31:
* No idea how or when this happen, but the alias for toggling socials had apparently adopted the name of the class for ... something. It was weird, and I've renamed the alias to SocialsToggle. 2.0 only.

Version 5.4.24, released 2017-07-31:
* Addressed punctuation issues in certain ground combat messages. Cheers Ryan for reporting this!
Afraid it's only addressed in VIP Mud 2.0, though. I'm almost at a point where I'll just discontinue support for VIP Mud 1.1 altogether, so if you would like to enjoy future changes and fixes to the soundpack, upgrading to VIP Mud 2.0 is the way to go.

Version 5.4.23, released 2017-07-31:
* The VD command will now give you the vd verb in the entry window, so it's easier to interact with the menu. For VIP Mud 2.0 only.

Version 5.4.22, released 2017-07-31:
* Whoops. A slight oversight there that caused conf vd to crash spectacularly. It's fixed now though.

Version 5.4.21, released 2017-07-31:
* Greatly improved virtual displays for VIP Mud 2.0. You can toggle them using the VD command. I added a few new virtual displays too (for flight control messages, metafrequency messages, and communicator messages), and they're all descriptively labelled! You can configure extra options for the virtual displays with conf vd, although not all of the options are fully implemented yet (like volume offset has no effect on some or most of the virtual displays yet). I also added a bunch of extra history buffers, like chatter, general, short range, intrasector combat, and much more.

Version 5.4.20, released 2017-07-31:
* Lots of improvements to the history review keystrokes in VIP Mud 2.0. You might need to check your buffer config though in case it's no longer working the way you want it. Just type bufferconfig to change the review buffers. I also removed the empty keystroke files for numpad and scanning, since they will never be used again at any rate. This could cause errors for those of you who have added custom keystroke file assignments, so if that's the case, please just remove that from your custom.set.

Version 5.4.19, released 2017-07-30:
* Ported the whoc (whocheck) command to the VIP Mud 1.1 version of the soundpack too. And as always, it's not tested since I don't have 1.1 myself, and so maybe it will work or maybe it won't work at all. Who knows.

Version 5.4.18, released 2017-07-30:
* Added a spinfo command that will show information about the soundpack, like version number, script path, sounds path, etc. You can use this command to verify that the soundpack is installed where you wanted it to be.
* Fixed an issue with the SPTest command that meant it would say that everything was fine, even if errors were detected.

Version 5.4.17, released 2017-07-30:
* Modified the output of the lag command so it's a little less confusing.

Version 5.4.16, released 2017-07-29:
* The conf gen option for keep-alive responses will now send the proper response for Miriani's lag test feature.
* SPKeepAlive will now cooperate more efficiently with Miriani's keep-alive feature. When the soundpack receives a keep-alive message, it will respond with a ping reply rather than initiating a new ping request.

Version 5.4.15, released 2017-07-28:
* SPKeepAlive will now restart itself after spreload, as it should.
* The message that indicates reloading complete after you use spreload will now also tell you to look in the room with your character so that the soundpack can update its environmental variables.

Version 5.4.14, released 2017-07-28:
* Fixed an issue where the option for keep-alive responses would interfere with SPKeepAlive.

Version 5.4.13, released 2017-07-28:
* Fixed a bug in SoundpackML that prematurely terminated certain code under certain conditions.
* Gave the SPKeepAlive 2 extra seconds to wait before starting up after you connect, to prevent Miriani from measuring your lag in the middle of lots of client processing which negatively affected the test results.

Version 5.4.12, released 2017-07-28:
* SPKeepAlive will now delay its startup until you have actually chosen your character from the character selection menu. The reason for this is that Miriani fails to respond to soundpack pings until you have actually woken up your character in Miriani, which caused SPKeepAlive to falsely report a broken connection after connecting.

Version 5.4.11:
* All changes since 5.2.3 that were marked as added to the 1.1 scripts have been tested, and they work as expected at the time of this entry. Thanks to Kendall for testing these things on an ancient computer running the even more ancient Vip 1.1.
* Updated the credits section, and added it to the 1.1 branch as well.
* Also added the development repository to GitHub! For those of you who would like to contribute code, the repo can be found at: https://github.com/tms88/Miriani-Soundpack-for-VIP-Mud

Version 5.4.10:
* Addressed an issue that prevented the option "conf PointUnit 2" from working. Thanks Adolin for reporting this, and for even providing me with the solution!
* Addressed another issue with the display of points stored in memory while out of comms that caused the decimal character to be a vertical bar instead of a period. Cheers again Adolin!

Version 5.4.9:
* The lag command will no longer send a ping request if you supply one of the following arguments: format, more, or token.

Version 5.4.8:
* Added a ping command, that allows you to play ping-pong with Miriani for the purpose of testing latency. Hurray! Go wild!

Version 5.4.7:
* Removed the "updating" alias. It was used for an old updating system that we no longer use. Thanks Josh for bringing it to my attention!

Version 5.4.6:
* Addressed an issue that caused computer announcements in vehicles (such as atmospheric salvagers) to be completely ignored by the soundpack. Cheers Cara for reporting this!

Version 5.4.5:
* Changed the default value for SPKeepAlive back to 0, because seeing the pings is annoying for those who have command echoing turned on, and there's currently no way to send commands from a script without them being routed through the same command echo thing. Horrible!

Version 5.4.4:
* Changed the default value for SPKeepAlive to 120. Better safe than sorry.

Version 5.4.3:
* Added more classes for specific environments. Also added all environmental classes to the 1.1 version in case I'll ever need it there too.

Version 5.4.2:
* By persistent demand, I have added the SPKeepAlive feature to the VIP Mud 1.1 compatible version of the soundpack too. And since I don't have VIP Mud 1.1 here, I can't test it myself, so let's just hope it works. If it doesn't, then please consider upgrading to VIP Mud 2.0 before this old 1.1 shit drives me nuts.

Version 5.4.1:
* Changed the default value for SPKeepAlive from 0 to 200. Yes, this means SPKeepAlive will be enabled by default (in VIP Mud 2.0 only).

Version 5.4.0:
* Added support for Miriani's new ping-pong mechanism! Hurray!
* The lag command will now use the new ping-pong mechanism to calculate how much lag you have.
* Added a keep alive feature to the soundpack (for VIP Mud 2.0 only). It will utilize the new ping-pong mechanism in Miriani, and you can set how often it should send a ping by typing SPKeepAlive. It will alert you if the connection is down.

Version 5.3.6:
* Tweaked the soundpack's lag command so that it now works in perfect harmony with Miriani's lag command.

Version 5.3.5:
* Fixed a bug with wormhole travelling. There was a message mentioning sounds of strained metal that should have triggered the sounds of strained metal in the soundpack. Now it does!

Version 5.3.4:
* Fixed a bug in SoundEngine that could potentially break the soundpack under certain conditions.

Version 5.3.3:
* More triggers are now using the environment toggles for better performance in VIP Mud 2.0. If you notice anything unusual, please let me know... on the soundpack board, or the soundpack metaf, or something.

Version 5.3.2:
* Hopefully made conf manager a teeny bit more resilient so it won't damage more configuration files for VIP Mud 2.0 users. Backup is never a bad thing at any rate, though.
* I've now started to toggle triggers based on environments. I'll keep adding this to more parts of the soundpack, which will result in a significant performance boost. Only for VIP Mud 2.0, though. Yes, it's definitely about time to update if you're still running the extremely ancient VIP Mud 1.1 release.

Version 5.3.1:
* Fixed a few bugs in the WHOCHECK command.

Version 5.3.0:
* Added a WHOCHECK command (can be shortened to WHOC), which will process the output from the WHO command and tell you if someone has connected or disconnected since last time you used the WHOCHECK command. It will also display a list of all players connected to the game (in alphabetical order). Currently the WHOCHECK command doesn't accept arguments, but maybe I'll implement some filtering functionality later that will require arguments. And last thing, this WHOCHECK command is only available for VIP Mud 2.0.

Version 5.2.6:
* Fixed a bug with scanning that was messing with the focused ship name, which caused problems for the enhanced locking sound system thinggymabob.

Version 5.2.5:
* The soundpack handles whirlpool messages in aquatic salvaging slightly better now.

Version 5.2.4:
* Added support for the new airlock cycle messages (in the VIP Mud 2.0 compatible version of the soundpack only).

Version 5.2.3:
* Fixed the ancient bug that caused camera feeds to make it look like the location of the feed itself was firing at the starship. I only fixed it for VIP Mud 2.0, since I had to use 2.0 specific code for this fix and I have no 1.1 installation that I can use for testing with 1.1 code.

Version 5.2.2:
* Improved the trigger for the pour sound.

Version 5.2.1:
* Added exception handling to the MStep routine. What this means to the typical end user is that there's even less chance that footsteps will trigger annoying errors under certain undesirable conditions.

Version 5.2.0:
* Changed the way the soundpack loads during the connecting process. Now it should (hopefully) load properly even with GEN-O 11 enabled! There is a chance I might have fixed other related issues too, and maybe I've even introduced new bugs. Who knows!

Version 5.1.18:
* The soundpack will now respect your experience level preference for correct processing of more Lore menu titles than ever before.

Version 5.1.17:
* Possibly addressed an issue where saved social toggles wouldn't load properly.

Version 5.1.16:
* Added a testing tool for the soundpack in the hope that it might be useful for figuring out which sections of the soundpack are causing the pack to crash. You can run it by typing SPTEST. I'll probably add more checks for the testing tool later.

Version 5.1.15:
* The soundpack will now forcibly set #Conf Explicit False, because a value of True would crash the soundpack at startup with a 100 percent certainty, and who would want that!?
* Added a note about Miriani's GEN-O 11 to the Troubleshooting section of the installation instructions.

Version 5.1.14:
* Added a sound for admin messages. I know it's a weird sound, but it was the best I could find in the soundpack without adding a brand new one and make everybody downloading the entire sounds folder just to get fully up to date.

Version 5.1.13:
* Added more shortcuts for the sm filters, e.g. A for artifacts, probe/video for satellites, roid for asteroids, etc. Usage: sm <filter>. For example: sm roids.
* Also fixed conditions where conf gen 16 (update alerts) was being ignored, even when it was not supposed to be ignored. Now the soundpack will abide by your preference unless there's a major update available. I'll only push major updates when the soundpack becomes incompatible with Miriani, just like when starmap and scan stopped working for older versions of this soundpack.
* That horrible update alert sound will now only play if there's a major update available. There shouldn't be any need to cause heart failure for poor jumpy souls every time I patch an obscure and insignificant bug.

Version 5.1.12:
* I thought I fixed the soundpack update notifications in version 5.1.4, but apparently it was still buggy. Now it should be more reliable than ever before!
* The soundpack will now also disregard conf gen 16 (update alerts) if there's a major update to the soundpack.

Version 5.1.11:
* Fixed a bug that could crashed the soundpack during the startup process. This affected you if you could see the following error message: "Undefined variable or unknown symbol in expression [@LOADIGFILES=] expression @LoadIGFiles=1 in command:"

Version 5.1.10:
* Added Indoor Pool to the list of room titles that the soundpack will recognize for the room sounds.

Version 5.1.9:
* Squashed a bug that was recently and inadvertently introduced that meant the soundpack didn't want to play the general sector transmission sound when you sent messages from station's, moon's, and planet's observation centers.

Version 5.1.8:
* The general sector communication sound should no longer be played if you LOOK inside a mining transport.

Version 5.1.7:
* Made minor adjustments to the volume of chatter and org channels. Org channels have been reduced from +30% to +20% of normal, and chatter has been increased to +10% of normal soundpack volume.

Version 5.1.6:
* The soundpack will now override and disable the built-in numpad macros in VIP Mud regardless of your configuration. Previously the soundpack would only do so if you had disabled the soundpack's support for numpad in conf advanced keystrokes.

Version 5.1.5:
* Removed keystroke Alt+Ctrl+/ since it was sending the COORDS command to the game, and thus would be considered an illegal macro.

Version 5.1.4:
* Improved the soundpack update notification thinggymabob. It will no longer complain about outdated version if your soundpack is more up to date than the version number registered in the game.

Version 5.1.3:
* The sc* commands will now bring up a menu of targets to scan if you don't specify a target. Basically, same behavior as the scan command.

Version 5.1.2:
* Fixed the soundpack update notification thinggymabob so it doesn't crash your life with horrific errors if you're using VIP Mud 2.0 in combination with an outdated version of the soundpack.

Version 5.1.1:
* Updated Installation instructions.txt. That file now also has a link for the soundpack sounds.

Version 5.1:
* To make the soundpack more compliant with Miriani's policies, the sc* commands will no longer remember last scanned target.

Version 5.0:
* The soundpack is now at version 5.0! Major changes for this release include the removal of scanning keystrokes, keystroke for gc, and also the numpad keystrokes should be gone for real this time! Also, we seemed to skip version 4.0 since something tells me it's already been used before in some extremely ancient version of this soundpack.
