Version 5.7.2, released 2017-08-13:
* For 2.0: More performance improvements. Rewrote the extras framework, and it's no longer being the huge resource hog that it used to be. You might even notice a slight performance boost when you enter and exit starships because of this change. Also added the extras menu to the new conf manager.

Version 5.7.1, released 2017-08-13:
* For 2.0: More performance improvements. Removed the menus framework since it was just annoying to lots of people, and it was hogging resources even when it was not really in use. And since many menus in Miriani now accepts text input, the menus framework was kind of obsolete at any rate. And finally layed the numpad.set file to rest, since it was consuming resources without being of any use to anyone in the slightest. These changes may cause things to crash that I haven't thought of, so please let me know if you encounter bugs or unexpected oddities.

Version 5.7.0, released 2017-08-12:
* For 2.0: A shiny new conf manager has now replaced the old and slow conf manager. I know there are still a few options missing, and I'll keep working on that. But I think the most essential stuff will work nicely. This new conf manager is much much better in terms of performance as well as usability. I also redesigned the keystroke framework. It's much faster too now.
* For 2.0: Fixed a bug with the secho framework that could potentially cause captions and options to get separated if the timing of other unrelated game output was not so right.

Version 5.6.12, released 2017-08-11:
* For 2.0: The RoomSounds command uses secho now.

Version 5.6.11, released 2017-08-11:
* For 2.0: The BufferConfig command now uses secho instead of command prefix in the entry window.

Version 5.6.10, released 2017-08-11:
* For 2.0: The VD command will now utilize secho in Miriani instead of printing a command prefix to the entry window.

Version 5.6.9, released 2017-08-11:
* Fixed more incorrect sound paths for certain salvager sounds. Thanks again, Daryk.

Version 5.6.8, released 2017-08-11:
* Fixed a few incorrect paths to salvage sounds. Thanks Daryk Karlsen for reporting this.

Version 5.6.7, released 2017-08-10:
* Removed some very old and now unused code from the trigger that plays the rel drive start sound.

Version 5.6.6, released 2017-08-08:
* For 2.0: Added a new soundpack prompt framework that utilizes the new secho command in Miriani. This probably doesn't mean anything for most users, but I'm currently in the process of rewriting the conf manager, and the new conf manager will definitely make good use of this new prompt framework.
* For 2.0: Added a history buffer for private link services. The buffer is named Services. This means services like auction service and combat mission notification service won't clutter your private comm history buffer. Woop woop! We might add a new sound for services too one day, who knows.

Version 5.6.5, released 2017-08-05:
* Applied a workaround for the issue with conf vol (and other conf aliases pointing to executable conf objects). Cheers Josh for reporting.

Version 5.6.4, released 2017-08-05:
* For 2.0: Fixed bugs in the bufferconfig command.

Version 5.6.3, released 2017-08-05:
* For 2.0: Changed the virtual displays for camera feeds. Now the first one applies for internal camera feeds, like internal stun turrets and security cameras on private space stations etc. vd 2 is for external camera feeds, like droid remotes and external cameras on BC's.

Version 5.6.2, released 2017-08-05:
* Josh Westen updated Docs/Keys.txt by removing a number of keystroke definitions that no longer exist in the soundpack because of not so recent policy changes in Miriani. Plus a few other modifications to that file.
* Removed script, sounds, and themes path options from conf advanced, since the preferred method for setting these paths now is by using the linking scripts. Also removed the file extension options and the ignored script files option, because the only thing you could do with them was to crash the soundpack, so not very useful. Also added a CExt variable for those of you who might be interested. The plan at this point is to compress some (or even most) of the sounds into mp3, and only use .wav for time critical things pertaining to missions, combat, grabbing, stunning, etc.

Version 5.6.1, released 2017-08-04:
* Implemented version control for sounds, and fixed numerous bugs that I spotted along the way. What the version control for sounds means to the end user is that the soundpack will now detect if you have the required version of the sounds folder before it attempts to play a new sound, instead of crashing your soundpack because the sound file doesn't exist. You will need to get the sounds folder that was released today though for this to work properly. The sounds folder will from this day on have support for this version control feature. You can download Miriani Soundpack Sounds.zip from the link in @soundpacks. If you have access to the Miriani Soundpack Sounds in Dropbox, then all of this will go automatically so there's nothing you'll need to do.

Version 5.6.0, released 2017-08-04:
* We've been tidying the sounds folder, and as a result of that, you might need to download the latest sounds folder unless you have access to the shared Dropbox folder for the sounds. The new sounds folder will also have a version number that VIP Mud can load programmatically, which means that future releases of the soundpack won't unceremoniously crash even if you don't have the most recent sounds folder. But first, you need to download the sounds folder that was released today.
* Also added some new sounds. There's a new sound for alliance computer notifications, and that old alliance computer sound is now used to alert you of blast door intrusions. Also added a sound for cutting torches, plus a new sound that indicates no nearby debris when salvaging. There are probably other changes too, but those are the ones I recall at this time.
* For 2.0: Removed a superfluous trigger in the name of performance, and also improved the little framework that handles computer report messages.

Version 5.5.13, released 2017-08-04:
* For 2.0: Added a little message for the first time you use whoc after the soundpack has been loaded.
* Addressed an issue where the soundpack wouldn't show you the color of the Lore computer that someone was using.
* For 2.0: Fixed several issues with messages starting with The computer reports. Now experience level 3 should filter that prefix and only show the relevant message.

Version 5.5.12, released 2017-08-03:
* For 2.0: Now the whoc command says checking when it starts, because the results are a bit slower to show up with this new workaround for whoc, and it just felt good to make it say something to fill the kind of awkward silence before the results come.

Version 5.5.11, released 2017-08-03:
* Fixed a horrible bug in the whoc command. It really messed up the soundpack if everyone happened to be in comms range, or if noone were out of local space. I had to apply a crazy workaround to make sure this will work regardless of the footer of the who command, which also means I just had to remove whoc entirely from the 1.1 version since I can't do the kind of extensive testing there that would be necessary to make this work. Also, whoc now utilizes the benefits of the command echo control in 2.0, which doesn't even exist in 1.1. So yeah, if you still want to use whoc, VIP Mud 2.0 is the way to go.
* For 2.0: Addressed the issue that caused intrasector subwarp, slip, etc to mess with camera feeds.
* For 2.0: Changed the default volume offsets for virtual displays from -10 to -20. This change will only apply for new configs.

Version 5.5.10, released 2017-08-03:
* For 2.0: Sound engine improvements. Now it uses a more correct formula for all the volume offsets. This means that you might need to reconfigure some of your volume diffs if things are suddenly a little bit too quiet or a little bit too loud. Previous behavior was that a volume offset would add or subtract from master volume. New formula treats the offsets as a percentage of master volume, which definitely makes volume management easier. I also made the sound engine a tad more efficient in terms of performance, by removing some unnecessary workarounds and things.

Version 5.5.9, released 2017-08-02:
* For 2.0: Debris salvage messages now use your experience level instead of a virtual display. It'll also use a little more sound effects to indicate that things are happening.
* For 2.0: Since I freed up a slot in the list of virtual displays, I decided to move the intrasector combat messages to VD 4, and add an extra display for droid remotes. You might need to reconfigure your virtual displays now though since your configuration won't take into account the new order of virtual displays.

Version 5.5.8, released 2017-08-02:
* Fixed a bug that made it look like people were in the same room with you if they used a Lore computer and your character saw it through a camera feed.

Version 5.5.7, released 2017-08-02:
* Added a helpful hint to the message you see when toggling command echo using conf gen commandecho.

Version 5.5.6, released 2017-08-02:
* Lots of changes in the version for VIP Mud 2.0. Removed the MOTD stuff from conf since it was just reserving resources that would never ever be used. Added conf gen CommandEcho, which sets whether or not commands sent to the game will be displayed in the output window. This effectively means that this option will override whatever you define in VIP Mud's option for displaying commands in the output window. The reason for this is that the soundpack will now have the ability to selectively choose whether or not a command should be displayed in the output window, which is useful for keep alive and other things that you just don't want to see in the output window. Also, the soundpack will now set the option for opening scripts in read only mode to True, and the option for auto save script changes to false. Hopefully that will prevent people from accidentally messing up their soundpacks and then complaining about soundpack not working.

Version 5.5.5, released 2017-08-02:
* Added character encoding for the rooc command.

Version 5.5.4, released 2017-08-02:
* Whoops. Apparently I created a major bug in the comms framework with version 5.5.3. It has been fixed now, hopefully.

Version 5.5.3, released 2017-08-02:
* Lots of improvements and bug fixes for camera feeds and virtual displays (for VIP Mud 2.0). Now the volume offsets for all virtual displays should work correctly.
* The beep for being granted access to a house works again. Thanks Ryan Salvatore for reporting this!

Version 5.5.2, released 2017-08-01:
* Volume offset for Virtual Display 5 and 6 (Metafrequency messages and Communicator messages) works now! (VIP Mud 2.0 only).

Version 5.5.1, released 2017-08-01:
* Added Turkish to conf comm encoding. I hope it works for those of you who speak turkish. For both VIP Mud 1.1 and 2.0.

Version 5.5.0, released 2017-08-01:
* Improved the character encoding engine in the soundpack. Now it will decode all special characters received through comms and the say command, regardless of your encoding settings. You need to configure your language in conf comm encoding if you want to transmit special characters, though. Currently it supports French, German, and Norwegian. Be aware that only this soundpack will be able to decode these special characters, but at least you can use it when talking privately with friends who also use this soundpack. Also, this new improved character encoding engine is not backward compatible with older versions of this soundpack, but I added it for both VIP Mud 1.1 and 2.0.
* Added Spanish to the character encoding engine for both VIP Mud 1.1 and 2.0. Can be configured in conf comm encoding.

Version 5.4.28, released 2017-08-01:
* Added Control 1-0 to the BufferConfig for the sake of list completion, plus it holds some useful information.

Version 5.4.27, released 2017-08-01:
* Added filters to virtual displays (for VIP Mud 2.0 only). You can configure these in conf vd, and they are useful if you want a virtual display to gag something only if it also matches a certain pattern.
* The vd menu will now also display any active display filters.

Version 5.4.26, released 2017-08-01:
* Another improvement to the VD command. Now if you type vd and a number, it will toggle that virtual display without opening up the entire menu. If you just type vd without any arguments however, it will present the menu and let you interact with it just like conf. Also made it so that it will save the settings if you choose 0 from the VD menu.

Version 5.4.25, released 2017-07-31:
* No idea how or when this happen, but the alias for toggling socials had apparently adopted the name of the class for ... something. It was weird, and I've renamed the alias to SocialsToggle. 2.0 only.

Version 5.4.24, released 2017-07-31:
* Addressed punctuation issues in certain ground combat messages. Cheers Ryan for reporting this!
Afraid it's only addressed in VIP Mud 2.0, though. I'm almost at a point where I'll just discontinue support for VIP Mud 1.1 altogether, so if you would like to enjoy future changes and fixes to the soundpack, upgrading to VIP Mud 2.0 is the way to go.

Version 5.4.23, released 2017-07-31:
* The VD command will now give you the vd verb in the entry window, so it's easier to interact with the menu. For VIP Mud 2.0 only.

Version 5.4.22, released 2017-07-31:
* Whoops. A slight oversight there that caused conf vd to crash spectacularly. It's fixed now though.

Version 5.4.21, released 2017-07-31:
* Greatly improved virtual displays for VIP Mud 2.0. You can toggle them using the VD command. I added a few new virtual displays too (for flight control messages, metafrequency messages, and communicator messages), and they're all descriptively labelled! You can configure extra options for the virtual displays with conf vd, although not all of the options are fully implemented yet (like volume offset has no effect on some or most of the virtual displays yet). I also added a bunch of extra history buffers, like chatter, general, short range, intrasector combat, and much more.

Version 5.4.20, released 2017-07-31:
* Lots of improvements to the history review keystrokes in VIP Mud 2.0. You might need to check your buffer config though in case it's no longer working the way you want it. Just type bufferconfig to change the review buffers. I also removed the empty keystroke files for numpad and scanning, since they will never be used again at any rate. This could cause errors for those of you who have added custom keystroke file assignments, so if that's the case, please just remove that from your custom.set.

Version 5.4.19, released 2017-07-30:
* Ported the whoc (whocheck) command to the VIP Mud 1.1 version of the soundpack too. And as always, it's not tested since I don't have 1.1 myself, and so maybe it will work or maybe it won't work at all. Who knows.

Version 5.4.18, released 2017-07-30:
* Added a spinfo command that will show information about the soundpack, like version number, script path, sounds path, etc. You can use this command to verify that the soundpack is installed where you wanted it to be.
* Fixed an issue with the SPTest command that meant it would say that everything was fine, even if errors were detected.

Version 5.4.17, released 2017-07-30:
* Modified the output of the lag command so it's a little less confusing.

Version 5.4.16, released 2017-07-29:
* The conf gen option for keep-alive responses will now send the proper response for Miriani's lag test feature.
* SPKeepAlive will now cooperate more efficiently with Miriani's keep-alive feature. When the soundpack receives a keep-alive message, it will respond with a ping reply rather than initiating a new ping request.

Version 5.4.15, released 2017-07-28:
* SPKeepAlive will now restart itself after spreload, as it should.
* The message that indicates reloading complete after you use spreload will now also tell you to look in the room with your character so that the soundpack can update its environmental variables.

Version 5.4.14, released 2017-07-28:
* Fixed an issue where the option for keep-alive responses would interfere with SPKeepAlive.

Version 5.4.13, released 2017-07-28:
* Fixed a bug in SoundpackML that prematurely terminated certain code under certain conditions.
* Gave the SPKeepAlive 2 extra seconds to wait before starting up after you connect, to prevent Miriani from measuring your lag in the middle of lots of client processing which negatively affected the test results.

Version 5.4.12, released 2017-07-28:
* SPKeepAlive will now delay its startup until you have actually chosen your character from the character selection menu. The reason for this is that Miriani fails to respond to soundpack pings until you have actually woken up your character in Miriani, which caused SPKeepAlive to falsely report a broken connection after connecting.

Version 5.4.11:
* All changes since 5.2.3 that were marked as added to the 1.1 scripts have been tested, and they work as expected at the time of this entry. Thanks to Kendall for testing these things on an ancient computer running the even more ancient Vip 1.1.
* Updated the credits section, and added it to the 1.1 branch as well.
* Also added the development repository to GitHub! For those of you who would like to contribute code, the repo can be found at: https://github.com/tms88/Miriani-Soundpack-for-VIP-Mud

Version 5.4.10:
* Addressed an issue that prevented the option "conf PointUnit 2" from working. Thanks Adolin for reporting this, and for even providing me with the solution!
* Addressed another issue with the display of points stored in memory while out of comms that caused the decimal character to be a vertical bar instead of a period. Cheers again Adolin!

Version 5.4.9:
* The lag command will no longer send a ping request if you supply one of the following arguments: format, more, or token.

Version 5.4.8:
* Added a ping command, that allows you to play ping-pong with Miriani for the purpose of testing latency. Hurray! Go wild!

Version 5.4.7:
* Removed the "updating" alias. It was used for an old updating system that we no longer use. Thanks Josh for bringing it to my attention!

Version 5.4.6:
* Addressed an issue that caused computer announcements in vehicles (such as atmospheric salvagers) to be completely ignored by the soundpack. Cheers Cara for reporting this!

Version 5.4.5:
* Changed the default value for SPKeepAlive back to 0, because seeing the pings is annoying for those who have command echoing turned on, and there's currently no way to send commands from a script without them being routed through the same command echo thing. Horrible!

Version 5.4.4:
* Changed the default value for SPKeepAlive to 120. Better safe than sorry.

Version 5.4.3:
* Added more classes for specific environments. Also added all environmental classes to the 1.1 version in case I'll ever need it there too.

Version 5.4.2:
* By persistent demand, I have added the SPKeepAlive feature to the VIP Mud 1.1 compatible version of the soundpack too. And since I don't have VIP Mud 1.1 here, I can't test it myself, so let's just hope it works. If it doesn't, then please consider upgrading to VIP Mud 2.0 before this old 1.1 shit drives me nuts.

Version 5.4.1:
* Changed the default value for SPKeepAlive from 0 to 200. Yes, this means SPKeepAlive will be enabled by default (in VIP Mud 2.0 only).

Version 5.4.0:
* Added support for Miriani's new ping-pong mechanism! Hurray!
* The lag command will now use the new ping-pong mechanism to calculate how much lag you have.
* Added a keep alive feature to the soundpack (for VIP Mud 2.0 only). It will utilize the new ping-pong mechanism in Miriani, and you can set how often it should send a ping by typing SPKeepAlive. It will alert you if the connection is down.

Version 5.3.6:
* Tweaked the soundpack's lag command so that it now works in perfect harmony with Miriani's lag command.

Version 5.3.5:
* Fixed a bug with wormhole travelling. There was a message mentioning sounds of strained metal that should have triggered the sounds of strained metal in the soundpack. Now it does!

Version 5.3.4:
* Fixed a bug in SoundEngine that could potentially break the soundpack under certain conditions.

Version 5.3.3:
* More triggers are now using the environment toggles for better performance in VIP Mud 2.0. If you notice anything unusual, please let me know... on the soundpack board, or the soundpack metaf, or something.

Version 5.3.2:
* Hopefully made conf manager a teeny bit more resilient so it won't damage more configuration files for VIP Mud 2.0 users. Backup is never a bad thing at any rate, though.
* I've now started to toggle triggers based on environments. I'll keep adding this to more parts of the soundpack, which will result in a significant performance boost. Only for VIP Mud 2.0, though. Yes, it's definitely about time to update if you're still running the extremely ancient VIP Mud 1.1 release.

Version 5.3.1:
* Fixed a few bugs in the WHOCHECK command.

Version 5.3.0:
* Added a WHOCHECK command (can be shortened to WHOC), which will process the output from the WHO command and tell you if someone has connected or disconnected since last time you used the WHOCHECK command. It will also display a list of all players connected to the game (in alphabetical order). Currently the WHOCHECK command doesn't accept arguments, but maybe I'll implement some filtering functionality later that will require arguments. And last thing, this WHOCHECK command is only available for VIP Mud 2.0.

Version 5.2.6:
* Fixed a bug with scanning that was messing with the focused ship name, which caused problems for the enhanced locking sound system thinggymabob.

Version 5.2.5:
* The soundpack handles whirlpool messages in aquatic salvaging slightly better now.

Version 5.2.4:
* Added support for the new airlock cycle messages (in the VIP Mud 2.0 compatible version of the soundpack only).

Version 5.2.3:
* Fixed the ancient bug that caused camera feeds to make it look like the location of the feed itself was firing at the starship. I only fixed it for VIP Mud 2.0, since I had to use 2.0 specific code for this fix and I have no 1.1 installation that I can use for testing with 1.1 code.

Version 5.2.2:
* Improved the trigger for the pour sound.

Version 5.2.1:
* Added exception handling to the MStep routine. What this means to the typical end user is that there's even less chance that footsteps will trigger annoying errors under certain undesirable conditions.

Version 5.2.0:
* Changed the way the soundpack loads during the connecting process. Now it should (hopefully) load properly even with GEN-O 11 enabled! There is a chance I might have fixed other related issues too, and maybe I've even introduced new bugs. Who knows!

Version 5.1.18:
* The soundpack will now respect your experience level preference for correct processing of more Lore menu titles than ever before.

Version 5.1.17:
* Possibly addressed an issue where saved social toggles wouldn't load properly.

Version 5.1.16:
* Added a testing tool for the soundpack in the hope that it might be useful for figuring out which sections of the soundpack are causing the pack to crash. You can run it by typing SPTEST. I'll probably add more checks for the testing tool later.

Version 5.1.15:
* The soundpack will now forcibly set #Conf Explicit False, because a value of True would crash the soundpack at startup with a 100 percent certainty, and who would want that!?
* Added a note about Miriani's GEN-O 11 to the Troubleshooting section of the installation instructions.

Version 5.1.14:
* Added a sound for admin messages. I know it's a weird sound, but it was the best I could find in the soundpack without adding a brand new one and make everybody downloading the entire sounds folder just to get fully up to date.

Version 5.1.13:
* Added more shortcuts for the sm filters, e.g. A for artifacts, probe/video for satellites, roid for asteroids, etc. Usage: sm <filter>. For example: sm roids.
* Also fixed conditions where conf gen 16 (update alerts) was being ignored, even when it was not supposed to be ignored. Now the soundpack will abide by your preference unless there's a major update available. I'll only push major updates when the soundpack becomes incompatible with Miriani, just like when starmap and scan stopped working for older versions of this soundpack.
* That horrible update alert sound will now only play if there's a major update available. There shouldn't be any need to cause heart failure for poor jumpy souls every time I patch an obscure and insignificant bug.

Version 5.1.12:
* I thought I fixed the soundpack update notifications in version 5.1.4, but apparently it was still buggy. Now it should be more reliable than ever before!
* The soundpack will now also disregard conf gen 16 (update alerts) if there's a major update to the soundpack.

Version 5.1.11:
* Fixed a bug that could crashed the soundpack during the startup process. This affected you if you could see the following error message: "Undefined variable or unknown symbol in expression [@LOADIGFILES=] expression @LoadIGFiles=1 in command:"

Version 5.1.10:
* Added Indoor Pool to the list of room titles that the soundpack will recognize for the room sounds.

Version 5.1.9:
* Squashed a bug that was recently and inadvertently introduced that meant the soundpack didn't want to play the general sector transmission sound when you sent messages from station's, moon's, and planet's observation centers.

Version 5.1.8:
* The general sector communication sound should no longer be played if you LOOK inside a mining transport.

Version 5.1.7:
* Made minor adjustments to the volume of chatter and org channels. Org channels have been reduced from +30% to +20% of normal, and chatter has been increased to +10% of normal soundpack volume.

Version 5.1.6:
* The soundpack will now override and disable the built-in numpad macros in VIP Mud regardless of your configuration. Previously the soundpack would only do so if you had disabled the soundpack's support for numpad in conf advanced keystrokes.

Version 5.1.5:
* Removed keystroke Alt+Ctrl+/ since it was sending the COORDS command to the game, and thus would be considered an illegal macro.

Version 5.1.4:
* Improved the soundpack update notification thinggymabob. It will no longer complain about outdated version if your soundpack is more up to date than the version number registered in the game.

Version 5.1.3:
* The sc* commands will now bring up a menu of targets to scan if you don't specify a target. Basically, same behavior as the scan command.

Version 5.1.2:
* Fixed the soundpack update notification thinggymabob so it doesn't crash your life with horrific errors if you're using VIP Mud 2.0 in combination with an outdated version of the soundpack.

Version 5.1.1:
* Updated Installation instructions.txt. That file now also has a link for the soundpack sounds.

Version 5.1:
* To make the soundpack more compliant with Miriani's policies, the sc* commands will no longer remember last scanned target.

Version 5.0:
* The soundpack is now at version 5.0! Major changes for this release include the removal of scanning keystrokes, keystroke for gc, and also the numpad keystrokes should be gone for real this time! Also, we seemed to skip version 4.0 since something tells me it's already been used before in some extremely ancient version of this soundpack.
