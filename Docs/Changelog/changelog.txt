Version 5.9.7, released 2017-10-16:
* Cleaned up some legacy code related to speech types that was only relevant in VIP Mud 1.1. Speech types in VIP Mud 2.0 can be either None, Sapi, or Screen reader.

Version 5.9.6, released 2017-10-15:
* Removed the entire experience level framework. It might make the soundpack slightly faster, and maybe it will also help bypassing the bug in VIP Mud that prevents aliases and keystrokes from being loaded properly.

Version 5.9.5, released 2017-10-14:
* Fixed a small bug with how conf exp 2 treated messages about lights flashing overhead.

Version 5.9.4, released 2017-10-08:
* Removed the conf option to have variables expanded in the entry window, since it served no purpose other than to fuck up things for people. As a consequence, I also removed conf vip, since there was only one option left in there and I thought it would be better to just move it to conf gen.

Version 5.9.3, released 2017-10-08:
* Fixed SPTest not working. Thanks Cria for reporting this.

Version 5.9.2, released 2017-10-08:
* The prod social will now produce the same sound as the poke social.

Version 5.9.1, released 2017-10-08:
* Fixed a bug in the conf loader that meant class states for socials, actions, and emotes weren't updated when using conf load.

Version 5.9.0, released 2017-10-08:
* For 2.0: Redesigned the soundpack loading framework. Hopefully the new one is a little bit faster and more stable. There might be a few new bugs though as a result of this change, but feel free to report them through appropriate channels, such as the soundpack metaf, or the soundpack board.
* For 2.0: Removed the option to save configuration when idle, since it's just unnecessary. The option to auto save on exit is much better.
* For 1.1: Officially discontinuing to maintain the soundpack for 1.1. Future updates will apply for 2.0 only, unless changelog entries indicate otherwise. The SP for 1.1 will no longer notify you of soundpack updates.
