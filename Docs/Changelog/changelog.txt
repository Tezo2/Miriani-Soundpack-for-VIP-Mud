Version 5.9.15, released 2017-10-21:
* Improved the focus output formatter string. Now it supports X, Y, and Z. It has also been moved from conf scan to conf ship. Furthermore, instead of showing the word unchanged, it will now beep when the coordinates change.

Version 5.9.14, released 2017-10-21:
* Fixed an oversight in the ship computer framework that prevented it from playing the control room report sound sometimes.

Version 5.9.13, released 2017-10-19:
* Merged the list of actions into the list of socials, since it's all just socials anyway. This also gives a little performance boost, since I could remove alot of duplicated code.

Version 5.9.12, released 2017-10-19:
* Added sound support for emotes. Remember to enable emotes in conf socials if you turned it off in a previous life.

Version 5.9.11, released 2017-10-19:
* Fixed certain starmap titles not being gagged when using starmap filters. Thanks Michael Calaway for reporting this!

Version 5.9.10, released 2017-10-18:
* Now it will also recognize vacuum-sealed packets of frozen food resembling star-shaped cookies. Hurray!

Version 5.9.9, released 2017-10-18:
* The soundpack will now attempt to be extra informational when you snatch artifacts from space. Maybe this will work when you look at artifacts too. Who knows.

Version 5.9.8, released 2017-10-18:
* SmFilters will try harder to avoid gagging things they shouldn't gag.

Version 5.9.7, released 2017-10-16:
* Cleaned up some legacy code related to speech types that was only relevant in VIP Mud 1.1. Speech types in VIP Mud 2.0 can be either None, Sapi, or Screen reader.

Version 5.9.6, released 2017-10-15:
* Removed the entire experience level framework. It might make the soundpack slightly faster, and maybe it will also help bypassing the bug in VIP Mud that prevents aliases and keystrokes from being loaded properly.

Version 5.9.5, released 2017-10-14:
* Fixed a small bug with how conf exp 2 treated messages about lights flashing overhead.

Version 5.9.4, released 2017-10-08:
* Removed the conf option to have variables expanded in the entry window, since it served no purpose other than to fuck up things for people. As a consequence, I also removed conf vip, since there was only one option left in there and I thought it would be better to just move it to conf gen.

Version 5.9.3, released 2017-10-08:
* Fixed SPTest not working. Thanks Cria for reporting this.

Version 5.9.2, released 2017-10-08:
* The prod social will now produce the same sound as the poke social.

Version 5.9.1, released 2017-10-08:
* Fixed a bug in the conf loader that meant class states for socials, actions, and emotes weren't updated when using conf load.

Version 5.9.0, released 2017-10-08:
* For 2.0: Redesigned the soundpack loading framework. Hopefully the new one is a little bit faster and more stable. There might be a few new bugs though as a result of this change, but feel free to report them through appropriate channels, such as the soundpack metaf, or the soundpack board.
* For 2.0: Removed the option to save configuration when idle, since it's just unnecessary. The option to auto save on exit is much better.
* For 1.1: Officially discontinuing to maintain the soundpack for 1.1. Future updates will apply for 2.0 only, unless changelog entries indicate otherwise. The SP for 1.1 will no longer notify you of soundpack updates.
