Miriani Soundpack for Vipmud -> Keystroke Definitions

This file attempts to document the keystrokes used by the soundpack, as people keep asking me for them, and I've not written them in yet.

In an attempt to group the keys, I will put two plus signs (++) in front of each section, and a single plus sign (+) in front of sub headings.

Key - Command or Action
++ Movement:
 + Player Movement:
Alt i - North
Alt o - Northeast
Alt l - East
Alt . - Southeast
Alt , - South
Alt m - Southwest
Alt j - West
Alt u - Northwest
Alt y - Up
Alt n - Down
Alt / - Speak last moved movement direction
Alt space - Speak exits (optionally count them with Conf Gen 6 enabled)
Alt [ - Go (or enter when in a ship airlock)
Alt ] - Out

 + Starship Movement:
All numpad keys switch to movement directions when outside a ship or vehicle, assuming Conf Gen Numpad 4 is enabled
Control alt shift j - 1
Control alt shift k - 2
Control alt shift l - 3
Control alt shift u - 4
Control alt shift i - 5
Control alt shift o - 6
Control alt shift 7 - 7
Control alt shift 8 - 8
Control alt shift 9 - 9
Control alt shift p - - (Or + with Conf Gen Numpad 3 enabled) (Does nothing without another key when Conf Gen Numpad 2 is enabled)
Control alt shift . - + (Or - with Conf Gen Numpad 3 enabled) (Does nothing without another key when Conf Gen Numpad 2 is enabled)
Alt shift / - Speak last moved ship direction
Control alt shift f11 - Silent
All numpad keys execute their own directions when ConfGen Numpad 1 is enabled, with the exception of:
Numpad + - + (Or - with Conf Gen Numpad 3 enabled) (Does nothing without another key when Conf Gen Numpad 2 is enabled)
Numpad - - - (Or + with Conf Gen Numpad 3 enabled) (Does nothing without another key when Conf Gen Numpad 2 is enabled)
Numpad 0 - AtSm (when in a vehicle)
Numpad * - SM
Numpad / - Opens a prompt window where you can type in numpad coordinates without them being treated as regular numpad commands

+ Left handed navigation.
With Conf numpad 4 is disabled, the default behavior is experienced, where the movement commands are on the right hand side, and the ship movement are on the left. If it is enabled, these bindings are shifted.

All these keys will add - when the shift key is added, or + when the control key is added, this behaviour is flipped when Conf Numpad 3 is enabled:

Alt e - 8
Alt r - 9
Alt f - 6
Alt c 3
Alt x - 2
Alt z - 1
Alt s - 4
Alt w - 7
Alt d - 5
Alt t - - (or + when ConfNumpad 3 is enabled)
Alt v - + (Or - when ConfNumpad 3 is enabled)
