This is a very quick and dirty guide for setting up the soundpack by hand.

1. Terminate VipMud. Make sure it's not running.

2. Copy the files from this folder into the Miriani folder. For VipMud 1.1 users, you'll find this where you installed VipMud. For 2.0, you should use the VIP Mud folder in your Documents folder (or wherever you choose to keep your VipMud data files).

3. You need to edit the file named conf.set. Open it up in Notepad or some other text editor thing, and edit the ScriptPath and the SoundsPath variables so that they point to the folders where the scripts and the sounds are located, respectively. Note that if you're using VipMud 1.1, you need to point the ScriptPath to the folder named Scripts for VIP Mud 1.1.

4. Enjoy!


Troubleshooting:
* Make sure you are using a legal version of VipMud. Cracked version of VipMud are known to crash the soundpack.
* Ensure that you have the latest version of the soundpack.
* If you're using VipMud 1.1, you might need to run it as administrator.

Good luck.
